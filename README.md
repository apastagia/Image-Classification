# Image-Classification
Machine Learning Project-8

In this project I've used bing-image-downloader installed via pip(python library).
The use of this library is to download different type of images which we have to classify. I've classified sunflower, rugby ball leather and ice cream cone.
Advantage:
  -> No need of manual work to make categorical directory and then download images according to that particular directory.(Download image from bing serach engine and place 
      it in specified directory)
      
!pip install ipython-autotime: It shows execution time for each code block. (optional)

Flatten: Make each image size same.
